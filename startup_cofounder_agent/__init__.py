"""Startup Co‑Founder Agent.

This package exposes a set of helper functions and a command line interface
for turning a simple business idea into a suite of helpful outputs:

* **Market Analysis** – summarising demand, market size, economic indicators
  and competitive landscape.
* **Landing Page Copy** – a concise piece of marketing text that can be
  featured on a website home page.
* **Pricing Tiers** – three or more price packages tailored to the target
  market, with clearly differentiated features.
* **Pitch Deck** – a PowerPoint file containing standardised slide
  templates covering a business overview, problem, solution, market
  opportunity, product & business model, go‑to‑market strategy, competitor
  analysis, team, financials and the funding ask.

The CLI entrypoint is exposed via ``python -m startup_cofounder_agent.cli``.
See the README in the project root for installation and usage details.
